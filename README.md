# Introduction-to-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning

## Project Description
In this hands-on project the goal is to build a python code for image classification from scratch to understand the nitty gritties of building and training a model and further to understand the advantages of neural networks. First we will implement a simple KNN classifier and later implement a Neural Network to classify the images in the SVHN dataset. We will compare the computational efficiency and accuracy between the traditional methods and neural networks.

## The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

## Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

● Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)

● Data fetching and understand the train/val/test splits.

● Implement and apply an optimal k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier 

● Print the classification metric report 

● Implement and apply a deep neural network classifier including (feedforward neural network, RELU activations) 

● Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation (cost stochastic gradient descent, cross entropy loss, cost functions) 

● Implement batch normalization for training the neural network 

● Understand the differences and trade-offs between traditional and NN classifiers with the help of classification metrics
